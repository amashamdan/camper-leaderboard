Camper Leaderboard
===========================================================
Welcome to Free Code Camp's Camper Leaderboard. This page is built with React.js and Sass.
The page displays the users who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
It is also possible to show the top earners of all time.

How to use
===========================================================
When the page is loaded, it shows the top earners in the last 30 days. The users are displayed in descending order according to how many points they earned on the last 30 days. The last colomn of the table shows the overall points of each user.

If the "All time points" header is clicked, the table shows the users who've earned the most points of all time, again displayed in descending order. The table also shows how many points each user earned in the last 30 days.

Enjoy!
